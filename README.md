# Static-Background-Changer
A C++ program to change or remove background of a video as long as it is static, has GUI version but I dont recommend, as the GUI version is made for my term project only and it won't work stably.
Require OpenCV(C++ ver) and FFmpeg pre-installed for image processing.
The GUI version requires WXwiget.
